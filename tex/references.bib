@article{Gawthrop:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Thermodynamic aspects of chemical reactions have a long history in the physical chemistry literature. In particular, biochemical cycles require a source of energy to function. However, although fundamental, the role of chemical potential and Gibb's free energy in the analysis of biochemical systems is often overlooked leading to models which are physically impossible. The bond graph approach was developed for modelling engineering systems, where energy generation, storage and transmission are fundamental. The method focuses on how power flows between components and how energy is stored, transmitted or dissipated within components. Based on the early ideas of network thermodynamics, we have applied this approach to biochemical systems to generate models which automatically obey the laws of thermodynamics. We illustrate the method with examples of biochemical cycles. We have found that thermodynamically compliant models of simple biochemical cycles can easily be developed using this approach. In particular, both stoichiometric information and simulation models can be developed directly from the bond graph. Furthermore, model reduction and approximation while retaining structural and thermodynamic properties is facilitated. Because the bond graph approach is also modular and scaleable, we believe that it provides a secure foundation for building thermodynamically compliant models of large biochemical networks.},

	N2 = {The bond graph approach to modelling biochemical networks is extended to allow hierarchical construction of complex models from simpler components. This is made possible by representing the simpler components as thermodynamically open systems exchanging mass and energy via ports. A key feature of this approach is that the resultant models are robustly thermodynamically compliant: the thermodynamic compliance is not dependent on precise numerical values of parameters. Moreover, the models are reusable owing to the well-defined interface provided by the energy ports. To extract bond graph model parameters from parameters found in the literature, general and compact formulae are developed to relate free-energy constants and equilibrium constants. The existence and uniqueness of solutions is considered in terms of fundamental properties of stoichiometric matrices. The approach is illustrated by building a hierarchical bond graph model of glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle.},

	N2 = {Decomposition of biomolecular reaction networks into pathways is a powerful approach to the analysis of metabolic and signalling networks. Current approaches based on analysis of the stoichiometric matrix reveal information about steady-state mass flows (reaction rates) through the network. In this work, we show how pathway analysis of biomolecular networks can be extended using an energy-based approach to provide information about energy flows through the network. This energy-based approach is developed using the engineering-inspired bond graph methodology to represent biomolecular reaction networks. The approach is introduced using glycolysis as an exemplar; and is then applied to analyse the efficiency of free energy transduction in a biomolecular cycle model of a transporter protein {$[$}sodium-glucose transport protein 1 (SGLT1){$]$}. The overall aim of our work is to present a framework for modelling and analysis of biomolecular reactions and processes which considers energy flows and losses as well as mass transport.},
