@article{Perelson:1974,
	Abstract = {The notion of a chemical reaction network is made precise in terms of electrical network theory by demonstrating that the mathematical formulation of chemical reactions can be viewed as a subset of abstract circuit theory. An algorithm is presented for constructing linear graph and bond graph representations of chemical reaction systems. Input-output considerations are treated, using a network model of open reaction systems. Network and graphical models are also employed to elucidate the mathematical structure of cellular transport and cellular transport-reaction systems.},
